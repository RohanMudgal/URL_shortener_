# URL_shortener_
A URL shortener is a web service that converts a long, cumbersome URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a shorter and more manageable version. The primary purpose of a URL shortener is to create compact and user-friendly links that are easier to share, remember, and distribute, particularly on platforms with character limits such as social media.
